An example parsing JSON using Circe and decoding via HTTP4S. Based on the gitter8 HTTP4s template.

# created via
sbt new http4s/http4s.g8

Given the Giter8 template https://github.com/http4s/http4s.g8 it wasn't completely obvious to me how to follow the Jokes example as a pattern to create my own decoder given my API. I reached out for assistance in the gitter8 template and was lucky to obtain some assitance. Then I'm documenting my pitfalls to hopefully assist other developers.
